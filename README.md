# Archives from DATA-312: Data Science Applications (Spring 2022)
An archive of my work from DATA-312: Data Science Applications, taken at American University (AU) in Washington D.C. during the Spring 2022 semester.

The primary language used is R and the `tidyverse` dialect.

## Layout
Work in this course entails a series of units divided by subject matter through which certain types of data have been analyzed. Each unit, labeled `HW#` contains 3-4 "homework" assignments. The final assignment for each unit is a RMarkdown document with which I construct a formal writeup of my findings in various experiments. A PDF render accompanies each such file.

- HW1: Introduction, Data Visualization
- HW2: Text and Sentiment Analysis
- HW3: Music Analysis with WAV and MIDI data
- HW4: Basic Machine Learning Techniques (linear regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM))
